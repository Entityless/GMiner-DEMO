# G-Miner

G-Miner is a general distributed system aimed at general graph mining.

G-Miner, a distributed toolkit, a popular framework for large-scale graph processing. G-Miner adopts a number of state-of-art graph based algorithms and formulates a set of key operations in graph processing related fields. We implement these operations as the APIs of G-Miner, which provide strong performance guarantees due to the bounds on computation and memory. Over and above them, G-Miner itself has a high parallelism with both CPU and network as well.


## Feature Highlights

- **General Graph Mining Schema:** G-Miner aims to provide a unified programming framework for implementing distributed algorithms for a wide range of graph mining applications. To design this framework, we have summarized common patterns of existing graphmining algorithms.

- **Task Model:** G-Miner supports asynchronous execution of various types of operations (i.e., CPU, network, disk) and efficient load balancing by modeling a graph mining job as a set of independent tasks. A task consists of three fields: sub-graph, candidates and context.

- **Task-Pipeline:** G-Miner provides the task-pipeline, which is designed to asyn-chronously process the following three major operations in G-Miner: (1)CPU computation to process the update operation on each task, (2)network communication to pull candidates from remote machines, and (3)disk writes/reads to buffer intermediate tasks on local disk of every machine.


## Getting Started

* **Dependencies Install**

  G-Miner is built with the same dependencies of our previous project [Pregel+](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/pregelplus/index.html). To install G-Miner's dependencies (e.g., MPI, HDFS), using the instructions in this [guide](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/pregelplus/documentation.html).

* **Build**

Please manually MODIFY the dependency path for MPI and HDFS in CMakeLists.txt in root directory.

```bash
$ export GMINER_HOME=/path/to/gminer_root  # must configure this ENV
$ cd $GMINER_HOME
$ ./auto-build.sh
```

* [**Tutorials**](docs/TUTORIALS.md)
### Web Demo
#### prerequisites
  * python 3.6
  * flask 0.12.2 : `$> pip install flask==0.12.2`
  * all G-Miner dependencies described above
#### Start and stop web server
  We suppose you have built and run G-Miner successfully now ( if not, please refer to **Build** and **Tutorial** previous to this step). Then just run following commands :
  ```bash
  $> cd $GMINER_HOME
  $> ./script/start_demo_server.sh
    * Serving Flask app "main"
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:2333/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  $> ./script/stop_demo_monitor.sh
  ```
